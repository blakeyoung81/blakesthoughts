3. **Test with different QR code readers** before printing
4. **Save backup copies** of the QR codes

## 🚨 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- ✅ URLs use random tokens so she can't guess them
- ✅ She must use the same device for all unlocks (localStorage)
- ✅ Build and deploy before giving her first QR code
- ✅ Test everything in incognito/private mode first
- ✅ Replace the sample PDF with your real invitation
