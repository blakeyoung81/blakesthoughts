					Hello! I'm Blake Young, a third-year medical student and software developer with a passion for the intersection of medicine and technology.
				</p>
				
				<p class="mb-4">
					My journey began during my undergraduate studies at Harvard, where I found myself both fascinated by human physiology and frustrated by the outdated tools clinicians were using. 
					This dual perspective led me to explore software development as a means to create better solutions for healthcare providers and patients alike.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Currently pursuing my MD at UAMS (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences), I split my time between clinical rotations and building tools that make medical education more accessible and healthcare delivery more efficient.
					This site serves as a repository for my thoughts on med-tech, personal projects, occasional poetry, and reflections on the practice of medicine.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Academic Background</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			My clinical training is in progress at UAMS, where I'm currently completing my third year rotations. I've gained experience in various healthcare settings, from large academic medical centers to rural community hospitals, gaining perspective on the diverse challenges facing our healthcare system.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-8">
			On the technical side, I'm particularly interested in natural language processing applications in healthcare, retrieval-augmented generation for medical education, and building intuitive interfaces for clinical decision support.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why "Blake's Thoughts"?</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			This site started as a digital garden â€” a place to cultivate ideas without the pressure of perfection. Some posts are polished essays, others are works in progress, and a few are just quick notes to myself that might be useful to others.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge freely. If you find something helpful or have thoughts to share, please reach out through the contact page.
