I keep doors open
with no one behind me,
just so stray sunbeams
slip through the gap.
I trace chipped murals
like braille,
feeling for lost daydreams
in every crack.

Then I breathe slowly,
letting Sunday
settle behind my ribs—
not for wisdom
or promised epiphanies,
but for myself…
for no reason at all.
