Can we talk
before you fade
into your next story?

Your Pokémon shirt,
a red cotton flag in the wind,
carried Charizard's emblem—
but you were the flame—
running, leaping,
building empires in the dirt.

Please don't finish laughing yet—
let that helmet tilt, just a little
further over your shining green eyes.

Keep your T-shirt untucked
Let's pretend
this day never ends.

The grownups call you in—
but I'd rather watch you linger,
dust dancing
around your sneakers
until dusk swallows the sky.

I'll study your footprints
while you keep teaching the world 

how to dream.
