I made this blog post today as I was reflecting on what the world needs most this fine day in August... A man's perspective on what the ideal National Girlfriend Day should look like.

## A Brief and Completely Accurate History of National Girlfriend Day

Legend has it that National Girlfriend Day was founded in 2004 by a desperate florist named Bob who realized that Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and the occasional "I'm sorry" bouquet weren't quite covering his mortgage payments. Bob, being a visionary entrepreneur, looked at the calendar and thought, "You know what August needs? More pressure on relationships." And thus, August 1st became the day when men across America suddenly remember they should probably text back faster and maybe, just maybe, put down the PlayStation controller long enough to plan something romantic.

The holiday quickly gained traction among greeting card companies, chocolate manufacturers, and that one friend who always posts overly sentimental couple photos on Instagram. What started as Bob's financial scheme has now evolved into a beautiful tradition where girlfriends everywhere get to experience the unique joy of watching their boyfriends frantically Google "romantic restaurant near me" at 2 PM on August 1st.

## The Reality Check

I guess if I'm being honest, I don't have to worry all that much about what the ideal National Girlfriend Day is supposed to be like. After all, there's no crystal ball in my future. My privilege is to keep holding out until I find someone I'll know so well that understanding her favorite way to spend a day will be as natural as breathingâ€”because it's what I've been trying to make happen every other day of the year as well. 

That being said... it never hurts to have a template.
