## A Brief and Completely Accurate History of National Girlfriend Day

Legend has it that National Girlfriend Day was founded in 2004 by a desperate florist named Harold hoping to deterministically increase demand as  "I'm sorry" bouquet weren't quite covering his mortgage payments. Harold, hoping to tap into a low demand market, thought "You know what August needs? More pressure on relationships." And thus, August 1st became the day when men across America suddenly remember they should probably text back faster and maybe, just maybe, put down the PlayStation controller long enough to plan something romantic.

The holiday quickly gained traction among greeting card companies, chocolate manufacturers, and quoxotic Instagram nastolgists. What started as Harold's financial scheme has now evolved into a beautiful tradition where girlfriends everywhere get to experience the unique joy of watching their boyfriends frantically Google "romantic restaurant near me" at 2 PM on August 1st. But this wasn't love, was it?

## The Template That Fails by Design

I was asked what I would do on a day like yesterday, if I were in a relationship. My answer: no different then the day before... Not because all days are perfunctory, but because the real goal isn't to make National Girlfriend Day feel extraordinary—it's to make National Girlfriend Day feel no different than the other wholly remarkable, intentional, transcendent 364 days that preceeded it.

The template becomes irrelevant when you're already working as hard as possible to make every ordinary Friday feel like the kind of day worth remembering. When you're putting that level of intention into every conversation, every shared silence, every small gesture that no one else will ever witness—that's when you realize enterprising Harold's holiday was solving the wrong problem entirely.
