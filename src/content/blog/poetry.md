Poetry is what happens when language realizes its own limitations. It is the attempt to say the unsayable, to capture the fleetng resonance of a moment before it dissolves into memory.

In a utilitarian world, poetry is an act of rebellion. It refuses to be efficient. It refuses to be clear in the way an instruction manual is clear. Instead, it aims for a different kind of clarity—the clarity of emotional truth.

A good poem is not a description of an experience; it is an experience in itself. It bypasses the analytical mind and speaks directly to the subconscious. It uses rhythm, sound, and image to evoke states of being that prose can only point at from a distance.

We need poetry because we are not just rational actors. We are dreamers, feelers, beings of depth and shadow. Poetry reminds us that there are dimensions of reality that cannot be measured, only felt.
