Religion is often dismissed by the modern mind as archaic superstition. Yet, the religious impulse—the longing for the transcendent, the ritualization of life, the binding of community—is fundamental to the human experience.

Regardless of whether one believes in the literal truth of dogmas, religions function as repositories of ancient wisdom. They are maps drawn by our ancestors to navigate the treacherous territory of the human soul. They offer structures for grief, frameworks for morality, and languages for awe.

The challenge of our age is not to discard these traditions, but to translate them. To separate the signal from the noise. To find the perennial truths hidden beneath the layers of history and culture.

Whether we look to the East or the West, the core message is often the same: the self is an illusion, love is the highest law, and we are part of a unity that transcends our understanding. In a fractured world, this reminder of our fundamental interconnection is more urgent than ever.
