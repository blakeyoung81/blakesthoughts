Bertrand Russell observed that societies often mistake wealth for virtue and power for wisdom. Our age has perfected this illusion, transforming billionaires into moral paragons whose fortunes seem to confirm their brilliance. Yet behind the myth lies a different reality: great fortunes are more often built on inheritance, exploitation, and the manipulation of economic systems than on exceptional talent or hard work. This narrative endures because it feeds our aspirations, making us believe that extreme wealth is both deserved and within reach.

The cost of this illusion is profound. It blinds us to structural inequalities and seduces us into defending a system designed to keep power concentrated in the hands of the few. We glorify those who hoard wealth and influence while neglecting those who sustain society—teachers, healthcare workers, and community builders. Bertrand Russell understood that true progress comes from questioning power, not worshipping it. To see billionaires as they are—not as demigods but as products of systems that reward accumulation over contribution—is the first step toward reimagining a society that values people over profit.
