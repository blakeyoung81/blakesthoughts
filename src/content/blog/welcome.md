> "Medicine, code, and poetry all start with curiosity."

This space will collect essays on med-tech, deterministic philosophy, and the occasional rant about Step 1 prep. I believe in the power of writing as a tool for clarifying thought, and I hope that sharing my reflections here might be helpful to others on similar journeys.

## Why This Site Exists

As someone who straddles the worlds of clinical medicine and software development, I've often found myself searching for communities that speak both languages fluently. This site is my attempt to contribute to that intersection - a place where:

- Medical concepts meet code solutions
- Clinical workflows inspire better software design
- Technology enhances, rather than complicates, healing

## What You'll Find Here

My writing will focus on several key areas:

1. **Med-Tech Innovation**: Projects, ideas, and reflections on building better tools for healthcare
2. **Learning in Public**: My journey through both medical education and software development
3. **Deterministic Philosophy**: Thoughts on causality, systems thinking, and their applications to health
4. **Poetry and Creative Works**: Because the humanities and sciences are not separate worlds

## An Invitation

This isn't meant to be a one-way broadcast. I welcome your thoughts, critiques, and collaborations. If something here sparks your interest or you see connections I've missed, please reach out through the [contact page](/contact).

Here's to curiosity, clarity, and code that heals.
