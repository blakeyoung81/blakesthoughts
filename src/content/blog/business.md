# Building Businesses While in Medicine

I've spent the last few years experimenting with startups alongside medical school, learning what sticks and what still needs work. Below are the stories, lessons, and visuals that capture the ride so far.

## Pausing Medical School to Build Prior Authorization AI

Stepping away from clinical rotations to build a prior-authorization automation startup was equal parts terrifying and exhilarating. I mapped out payer policies, ingested them into a rules engine, and paired it with an LLM that generated draft submissions with supporting documentation. Early pilots showed that we could cut hours of back-and-forth for clinicians while improving approval rates.

The biggest takeaway: automation is only as good as the edge cases you design for. I spent countless nights reviewing denial letters to teach the model what not to do and built feedback loops so physicians could correct outputs in one click.

## Launching IvyTutoring Med

IvyTutoring Med grew as a specialized branch of IvyTutoring, designed for medical students. We use AI to digest complex content into bite-sized prompts, adaptive quizzes, and concise explanations that keep pace with dense curricula. The platform tracks weak spots, generates targeted practice, and nudges learners before exams.

Running small cohorts taught me that community matters as much as content. Office hours, shared flashcard decks, and study sprints kept students engaged and produced better outcomes than solo self-study alone.

## Creating Ivy Sprouts

Ivy Sprouts is the preschool and kindergarten arm of IvyTutoring. It uses friendly AI-guided songs and activities to help young kids pick up classroom skills while keeping the tone playful and age-appropriate. We prototyped call-and-response songs, simple phonics games, and sticker-style rewards that make learning feel like playtime.

Parents loved the short, repeatable routines they could run before school. Teachers appreciated printable lyrics and activity cards that paired with each track, making it easy to bring AI-generated content into real classrooms.

## Commissioning IvyTutoring's Pre-Clinical Courses

I hired a developer to build IvyTutoring's first- and second-year medical courses with gamified elements. We attracted about 10 signups, but I learned that real gamification needs thoughtful experience design—not just some quick flash games stitched together. The mini-games we launched were fun for a week, then engagement dipped.

Next time, I'll co-design gameplay mechanics with educators before shipping, build longer progression arcs, and budget for art and sound that make the experience feel cohesive. The experiment reminded me that education products win when pedagogy and play are equally intentional.

## Automating Payroll with Venmo

I wrote custom Python scripts to automate payroll through Venmo, reducing manual transfers and reconciliation. The setup handles scheduling, receipts, and simple reporting so I can focus on product work instead of payouts. Every Friday, the script calculates tutor hours from a shared spreadsheet, issues transfers, and emails a summary with confirmation links.

The automation eliminated hours of repetitive work and reduced mistakes. It also gave me confidence to scale contractor headcount without dreading payroll week.

## Navigating the Invisible Growth Stage

Once you start shipping products, collaboration offers show up quickly. The real challenge is pushing through the invisible growth stage—staying focused on compounding momentum before the market notices. I had to learn to say no to distracting partnerships, double down on core users, and keep a cadence of shipping even when metrics moved slowly.

Momentum compounded quietly: weekly releases, honest check-ins with early adopters, and a willingness to sunset features that didn't earn their keep.

## Building an AI Video Editing Workflow

I set up an AI-assisted video editing pipeline that enabled me to publish more than 900 videos to YouTube, helping the channel reach 1,500 subscribers. Automation handled clipping, captions, and basic edits so I could prioritize scripting and storytelling. A series of Python workers pulled footage from cloud storage, generated hook-based titles, and batched uploads overnight.

This workflow taught me that consistency beats perfection. Shipping daily—even with lightweight edits—built trust with viewers and surfaced which topics resonated.

## Daily Instagram Question Uploads

A Python script now posts fresh questions to Instagram every day. It selects items from a question bank, formats them into branded templates, and schedules uploads with captions and hashtags. The automation keeps social channels active while freeing up time for deeper product and content work.

Engagement rose once the feed became reliably active. Daily questions sparked comments from students comparing answers, which fed back into future content ideas.
