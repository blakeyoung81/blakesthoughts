An essay is an attempt—a trial. It is the mind wrestling with itself, trying to carve order out of chaos. 

We write not because we have the answers, but because we have questions that demand form. The act of writing is an act of discovery. In articulating a thought, we change it. We subject it to the rigor of language, and in doing so, we often find that what we believed was true is only a shadow of a deeper reality.

My essays are my breadcrumbs. They are markers of where I have been and where I am going. They are invitations to dialogue, both with myself and with you, the reader.

In a world drowning in noise, the essay remains a sanctuary for slow thought. It is a space where nuance is celebrated, where contradiction is explored, and where the goal is not to win an argument, but to understand.
