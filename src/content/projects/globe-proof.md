# Globe Proof

**Globe Proof** is an immersive 3D Earth visualization project that pushes the boundaries of web-based graphics. It provides a realistic and interactive model of our planet directly in the browser.

## 🌍 Key Features

### Realistic Rendering
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Custom shader implementation for a glowing, realistic atmosphere that reacts to lighting angles.
- **Dynamic Textures**: High-resolution texturing for landmasses, oceans, and cloud layers.
- **Lighting**: Accurate sun positioning and day/night cycle simulation.

### Interactivity
- **Smooth Controls**: Intuitive orbital controls allow users to rotate, zoom, and pan around the globe seamlessly.
- **Responsive**: Fully optimized for performance across devices, ensuring smooth frame rates even on mobile.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with modern 3D web technologies:
- **Three.js**: The core 3D engine handling the scene, camera, and renderer.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, enabling declarative scene composition.
- **Vercel**: Deployed for high-performance edge delivery.
