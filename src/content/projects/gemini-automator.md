## Overview

Gemini Automator streamlines repetitive Gemini workflows so you can focus on experimenting with prompts instead of clicking through the UI. The extension queues prompts, triggers send actions, and captures responses you specify without sending any of your data to external servers.

## Key capabilities

- **Prompt queuing and playback:** Preload prompt batches and run them in sequence while you monitor results.
- **Action automation:** Handle clicks, prompt submission, and response collection on the Gemini page for faster iteration.
- **Local-first design:** Configuration and saved prompts stay in your browser via `chrome.storage.local` so nothing leaves your device.

## Privacy first

The extension does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data. A dedicated privacy policy lives at the [Gemini Automator Privacy Policy](/privacy/gemini-automator), and all settings remain local to your browser.

## Contact

For support or questions about the automation or privacy approach, reach out through the Chrome Web Store support channel.
