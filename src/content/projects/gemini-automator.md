# Gemini Automator

Gemini Automator streamlines your Google Gemini workflows by automating repetitive chat actions. You can stack prompts into a queue, let the extension type and submit them, and even trigger downloads for generated images. Everything happens locally in the browser, so sensitive prompts never leave your device.

## What it does

- Lets you preload and reorder a queue of prompts.
- Automates typing, submission, and download steps so you can focus on reviewing results.
- Keeps your workspace organized with saved settings in `chrome.storage.local`.

## Privacy-first automation

The extension never transmits data to external servers. Prompt queues, settings, and any page interactions stay on-device. For more details, read the dedicated privacy policy linked below.
