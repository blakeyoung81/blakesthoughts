# LuzBuddy Smart Home Control Center

LuzBuddy is an innovative smart home control system that transforms how you interact with your connected devices. Instead of scrolling through endless lists of switches and sliders, LuzBuddy presents your entire home as an interactive 3D environment where you can visualize and control everything at a glance.

## The Vision

Traditional smart home apps treat your house as a collection of disconnected devices. LuzBuddy treats your home as a cohesive space, allowing you to see the relationships between rooms, understand device placement, and control everything through an intuitive 3D interface.

## Key Features

### 3D House Visualization
- Upload your house layout as a 3D model (.glb format)
- Navigate through rooms with intuitive camera controls
- See device placement in context of your actual living space

### Device Management
- Drag and drop devices from the device panel into your 3D house
- Upload custom 3D models for each device
- Organize devices by room and location
- Quick access to all devices with visual status indicators

### Multi-House Support
- Manage multiple properties from a single interface
- Switch between houses with the dropdown menu
- Create new house configurations on the fly

### Interactive Controls
- Left-click to toggle lights directly in the 3D view
- Right-click to pan the camera
- Scroll to zoom in and out
- Real-time visual feedback for all actions

### Live Activity Monitoring
- Track device activity in real-time
- Visual activity graphs and analytics
- Monitor energy usage and device status

## Technical Implementation

Built with Next.js and TypeScript, LuzBuddy leverages modern web technologies to deliver a smooth, responsive experience. The 3D rendering uses WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, ensuring smooth performance even with complex house models and multiple devices.

The system is designed to integrate with popular smart home platforms, allowing you to connect your existing devices without replacing your current infrastructure.

## User Experience

The interface features a dark theme with purple accents, creating a modern, futuristic aesthetic that matches the advanced functionality. The layout is clean and organized, with:

- **Devices Panel**: Quick access to all your smart devices
- **3D View**: The main interactive canvas for your home
- **House Selector**: Easy switching between multiple properties
- **Activity Monitor**: Real-time insights into your home's activity

## Future Enhancements

Planned features include:
- Voice control integration
- Automated scene creation based on usage patterns
- Mobile app for on-the-go control
- Advanced scheduling and automation rules
- Integration with more smart home ecosystems
